TO DO:
Move game logic into module and get game working (implemented).
Refactor at bats into one function using top(away) and bottom(home) of inning (implemented).
Extra innings in case of tie (implemented). 
Get change sides message to display once per loop instead of twice (implemented).

Player classes/stats: 
    Hitting increases chance to hit a pitch by 5% per level (implemented). 
    Pitching reduces a chance to hit a pitch by 3% per level (implemented).
    Defense increases a chance of catching the ball for an out by 3% per level (implemented).
    Split Player class into Pitcher/Outfield classes. Outfielders have no need for a pitching stat (implemented).
    Retool team generation to make one pitcher and 8 outfielders (implemented).

Add bases and base runners:
    Add chance of doubles/triples/home run on hit. Possibly tied to hitting stat?
    Add bases loaded/grand slam flourishes. Sound bytes?
    Add double/triple plays for defenders.
    Add stealing bases for base runners.

Figure out if there's a way to exclude non-latin characters from name API call.
